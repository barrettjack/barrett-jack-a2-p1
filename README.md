# Introduction to Game Development - Assignment 2 Part 1

In assignment 1, we were tasked with constructing a simple, 2D platformer environment; a "hello, world!" program in Unity. In this assignment, we've extended this world in a few dimensions. First, we've added player movement and control. And second, we added moving platforms. Both of which feature physical interaction, as you would expect.

Note: this project features liberal use of assets from [kenney.nl](kenney.nl). Namely, the spritesheets contained in the following asset packs:

- [Pixel platformer](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/pixel-platformer)
- [Pixel platformer: food expansion](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/pixel-platformer-food-expansion)
- [1-bit platformer](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/1-bit-platformer-pack) 

Please note that, at the time of creating this repository, these assets had been made available under the [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/).

### Detailing which assignment requirements have been met

*All of the requirements listed in the assignment description are satisfied.*

- The player clearly has movement and idle animations; run to verify.
- The player has a movement script that clearly satisfies the requirements.
- Physical bounds of the player have been adjusted to match the bounds of the sprite.
- Grid separates interactable layers from non-interactive ones, and smooth contact is setup appropriately as detailed in the slides.
- Moving platforms (in the underworld section!) are setup exactly as detailed in the slides.
- Camera follows player via parenting.
- Quality, of course, is subjective. I think my world is reasonably nice!
